I'm sure a little bit of JavaScript never hurt anyone.<li>Anyway, as one can pretty easily tell this website is heavily based on the <a href=https://undertale.com rel=noreferrer>Undertale</a> battle screen. It's not perfect by any means but it's good enough for me to be happy with it.<li>I couldn't do all this if it wasn't for these magnificent people that made the undertale fonts in the first place: <ul><li>DETERMINATION MONO - As you can see It's the font I use for the main text, it is made by <a href=https://www.behance.net/gallery/31268855/Determination-Better-Undertale-Font rel=noreferrer>Haley Wakamatsu</a>.<li><span style="font-family: monsterf; font-size: 0.75em;">monsteR friend 2</span> - These three fonts are used for the title of the page, they're just layered on top of each other and given different colors. The fonts are also made by <a href=https://www.behance.net/gallery/100106185/Monster-Friend-2 rel=noreferrer>Haley Wakamatsu</a>.<li><span style="font-family: mercy; font-size: 0.8em">mercy</span> - This is the font I use for the menu buttons, it is made by <a href=https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1021503/mercy-1 rel=noreferrer>MaxiGamer</a>.<li><span style="font-family: hp; font-size: 0.75em;">UT HP</span> - Honestly I'm not even sure about the name of the font. I tried to find it everywhere and the only proof of its existence in the form of a downloadable font was by <a href=https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1695563/ut-hp-font rel=noreferrer>SevenC</a>.<li><span style="font-family: mars">Mars Needs Cunnilingus</span> - I don't even know who the author of the font is but they sure as hell were really original when naming it.</ul></ul></div></main><div id=hud><span id=hud-text>frisk</span><span id=hud-lv>LV 1</span><div id=hud-right><span id=hud-hp>HP</span><div id=hud-hpbar></div><span id=hud-kr>KR</span><span id=hud-text2>20 / 20</span></div></div><footer><a class=unselected href=/> <div><span>#</span><span>home</span></div> </a><a class=unselected href=/call/> <div><span>$</span><span>call</span></div> </a><a class=unselected href=/blog/> <div><span>%</span><span>blog</span></div> </a><a class=unselected href=/code/> <div><span>&</span><span>code</span></div> </a></footer>
