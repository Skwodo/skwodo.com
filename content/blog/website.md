# Holy moly 
* The website is finally *somewhat* done. honestly the hardest part about all of this was actually starting.
* This was originally meant to be a pure HTML and CSS website but I realized that unfortunately
CSS absolutely sucks when it comes to randomizing literally anything so I had no choice. I'm sure a little bit of JavaScript never hurt anyone.
* Anyway, as one can pretty easily tell this website is heavily based on the [Undertale](https://undertale.com) battle screen. It's not perfect by any means but it's good enough for me to be happy with it.
* I couldn't do all this if it wasn't for these magnificent people that made the undertale fonts in the first place:
    * DETERMINATION MONO - As you can see It's the font I use for the main text, it is made by [Haley Wakamatsu](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31268855/Determination-Better-Undertale-Font).
    * <p style="font-family: monsterb; font-size: min(3.3vw,12pt);">monsteR friend 2</p>
      <span style="font-family: monsterc; font-size: min(3.3vw,12pt);">monsteR friend 2</span>

      <span style="font-family: monsterf; font-size: min(3.3vw,12pt);">monsteR friend 2</span> - These three fonts are used for the title of the page, they're just layered on top of each other and given different colors. The fonts are also made by [Haley Wakamatsu](https://www.behance.net/gallery/100106185/Monster-Friend-2).
    * <span style="font-family: mercy; font-size: min(3.75vw, 14pt);">mercy</span> - This is the font I use for the menu buttons, it is made by [MaxiGamer](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1021503/mercy-1).
    * <span style="font-family: hp; font-size: min(3.3vw,12pt);">UT HP</span> - Honestly I'm not even sure about the name of the font. I tried to find it everywhere and the only proof of it's existence in the form of a downloadable font was by [SevenC](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1695563/ut-hp-font).
    * <span style="font-family: mars">Mars Needs Cunnilingus</span> - I don't even know who the author of the font is but they sure as hell were really original when naming it.
